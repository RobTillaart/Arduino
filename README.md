# Arduino libraries

**NOTE** these libraries all have their own repo under https://github.com/RobTillaart?tab=repositories

So this repository does not have the latest version of all libs anymore. 
That said I will update this bulk repo on request or if time permit.


### Introduction

This repository contains several Arduino libraries I have written to be used in applications. 
Most of them include example code how the libraries can be used. 
Furthermore this repository contains a few stand alone applications.


### Questions

For questions about the usage of the libraries, please post a question on the Arduino 
forum at http://forum.arduino.cc/


### Bugs and issues

**Please check if the library has its own repo first and fill an issue there**

For bugs in the libraries, please fill in an issue in Github as that makes it far easier to track them. 
If possible provide a minimal code snippet that exposes the bug. 
Add information about platform used and version etc.
Also proposals for solutions are welcome.

Other issues are not directly bugs but still problematic.
E.g. if a library is too slow for your application that is an serious issue, not a bug. 
Please fill in an issue and provide as much details about your requirements.
Maybe I can help to fix it.


### Improvements and changes

For improvements and changes, please provide a pull request. 
I will try to follow up on them asap but it can take quite some time. 
Please try to be generic in your improvements and try to see "over the needs of your own application".

There is no guarantee that pull requests will be honored.
In such case feel free to start your own modified library from a fork.


### License and Warranty

I appreciate if you give credits when appropriate.

Please check the file LICENSE.md for the details.
