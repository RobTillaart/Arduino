# 74HC138

Arduino library for the 74HC138 3-to-8 line decoder/demultiplexer.


## Description

This library controls the 74HC138 3 to 8 line decoder.
With 3 IO lines one can select one of 8 output lines.

Note: **setLine(line)** changes the 3 pins not simultaneously.
So there is a very short time that non selected output can be enabled.
In extremis all three pins change, e.g. from line 0 to line 7, 
one goes from 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 7
To prevent this behaviour one need to use **disable()** and **enable()**.


```
selector.disable();
selector.setLine(line);
selector.enable();
```

## Interface

```cpp
#include "74HC138.h"
```

### Constructor

- **74HC138(uint8_t pin0, uint8_t pin1, uint8_t pin2, uint8_t pinEnable = 255)**
set the 3 selection IO lines from pin numbers.
Optionally set the enable pin, connect to E1 or E2, see datasheet.
- **74HC138(uint8_t \* pins, uint8_t pinEnable = 255)**
set the 3 selection IO lines from an array.
The pins array should have at least 3 elements.
Optionally set the enable pin, connect to E1 or E2, see datasheet.


### Select line

- **bool setLine(uint8_t line)** set line 0 .. 7. Returns false if out of range.
- **uint8_t getLine()** returns 0 .. 7
- **void nextLine()** selects the next line, wraps back to 0 if needed.
- **void prevLine()** selects the previous line, wraps to 7 if needed.


### Enable

These functions only work if the **pinEnable** line is set in constructor.

- **void enable()** enables output / selection.
- **void disable()** disables output / selection.
- **bool isEnabled()** checks if line is enabled.


## Future

#### Must

- improve documentation
- get hardware to test

#### Should

- add example with enable line.

#### Could


#### Wont

- guard the enable lines, user needs to do it
