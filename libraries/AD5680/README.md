# AD5680

Arduino library for the AD5680 series digital analog convertor (18 bit).


## Description

**Experimental**

The AD5680 is a 18 bit DAC on paper but in fact it is a 16 bit DAC.
To get the 18 bits a 2 bit duty cycle is used to implement the last two bits.
This means that the output voltage will be fluctuating unless the two
least significant bits are 0 (zero). To dampen this fluctuation the datasheet
advises to add a LOW pass filter after the output.

Feedback, issues, improvements are welcome. 
Please file an issue on GitHub.


#### 0.3.0 Breaking change

Version 0.3.0 introduced a breaking change to improve handling the SPI dependency.
The user has to call **SPI.begin()** or equivalent before calling **AD.begin()**.
Optionally the user can provide parameters to the **SPI.begin(...)**


#### 0.2.0 breaking change

The version 0.2.0 has breaking changes in the interface. 
The essence is removal of ESP32 specific code from the library. 
This makes it possible to support the ESP32-S3 and other processors in the future. 
Also it makes the library a bit simpler to maintain.

Note the order of the parameters of the software SPI constructor has changed in 0.2.0.

## Interface

```cpp
#include "AD5680.h"
```

### Base class

- **AD5680(uint8_t slaveSelect, SPIClassRP2040 \* mySPI = &SPI)** constructor hardware SPI (RP2040 specific). 
Sets internal value to zero.
- **AD5680(uint8_t slaveSelect, SPIClass \* mySPI = &SPI)** constructor hardware SPI. 
Sets internal value to zero.
- **AD5680(uint8_t slaveSelect, uint8_t spiData, uint8_t spiClock)** constructor software SPI.
Sets the software SPI pins.
Sets internal value to zero.
- **void begin()** initializes the SPI and sets internal state.
- **uint8_t getType()** returns 18 (for now).


### Set DAC

- **bool setValue(uint32_t value)** set value to the output immediately, 
effectively a prepare + update in one call.
Returns false if value out of range.
- **uint32_t getValue()** returns set value 0..262143 (from cache).
At power up the AD5680 will be reset to 0 (== 0 volt).
- **bool setPercentage(float percentage)** sets the output as a percentage 0..100.
If percentage is out of range, it is not set and the function returns false.
- **float getPercentage()** returns percentage, wrapper around **getValue()**.
Might return a slightly different value than **setPercentage()** due to 
rounding errors.


#### SPI 

- **void setSPIspeed(uint32_t speed)** sets SPI clock in **Hz**,
please read datasheet of the ADC first to get optimal speed.
- **uint32_t getSPIspeed()** gets current speed in **Hz**.
- **bool usesHWSPI()** returns true if HW SPI is used.


## Performance

Measurements with AD5680_demo.ino - setValue() most important.
(numbers are rounded).

|  version  |  board  |  clock    |  SPI  |  samples / second  |  Notes  |
|:---------:|:-------:}:---------:|:-----:}:------------------:|:--------|
|   0.1.1   |  UNO    |   16 MHz  |  HW   |    53500           |
|   0.1.1   |  UNO    |   16 MHz  |  SW   |     2800           |
|   0.1.1   |  ESP32  |  240 MHz  |  HW   |    91000           |  1
|   0.1.1   |  ESP32  |  240 MHz  |  SW   |   111000           |


1. ESP32 HW is equal performant for HSPI and VSPI. 
   Unknown why HW SPI is 20% slower than SW SPI (transaction overhead?)

50000 - 100000 samples per second means that a 1 KHz wave can be 
constructed with 50-100 values per period.


## Future

#### Must

- improve documentation
- get test hardware
- test the library

#### Should

- add examples

#### Could


#### Wont
