# ADS1X15

Arduino library for I2C ADC ADS1015, ADS1115, and similar.

For using I2C ADC with Raspberry pi or other SBC with Linux OS,
you can check similar library [here](https://github.com/chandrawi/ADS1x15-ADC).


## Description

This library should work for the devices mentioned below,
although not all sensors support all functionality.

|  Device   |  Channels  |  Resolution  |  Max sps  |  Comparator  |  Interrupts  |  ProgGainAMP  |  Notes   |
|:---------:|:----------:|:------------:|:---------:|:------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:---------|
|  ADS1013  |      1     |       12     |    3300   |       N      |       N      |        N      |          |
|  ADS1014  |      1     |       12     |    3300   |       Y      |       Y      |        Y      |          |
|  ADS1015  |      4     |       12     |    3300   |       Y      |       Y      |        Y      |          |
|  ADS1113  |      1     |       16     |    860    |       N      |       N      |        N      |          |
|  ADS1114  |      1     |       16     |    860    |       Y      |       Y      |        Y      |          |
|  ADS1115  |      4     |       16     |    860    |       Y      |       Y      |        Y      |  Tested  |


As the ADS1015 and the ADS1115 are both 4 channels these are the most
interesting from functionality point of view as these can do
differential measurements.


### Interrupts

Besides polling the ADS1x14 and ADS1x15 support interrupts to maximize throughput 
with minimal latency. For this these device has an ALERT/RDY pin. 
This pin can be used both for interrupts or polling, see table of examples below.

|   example                         |  Interrupts  |  notes  |
|:---------------------------------:|:------------:|:-------:|
|  ADS_1114_two_continuous.ino      |      Y       |
|  ADS_continuous_3_channel.ino     |      Y       |
|  ADS_continuous_4_channel.ino     |      Y       |
|  ADS_continuous_8_channel.ino     |      Y       |
|  ADS_continuous_differential.ino  |      Y       |
|  ADS_high_speed_differential.ino  |      Y       |
|  ADS_read_async_rdy.ino           |   polling    |
|  ADS_read_RDY.ino                 |   polling    |


### 0.5.0 Breaking change

Fixed #80, setComparatorPolarity() and setComparatorLatch() as these inverted
the setting.


### 0.4.0 Breaking change

Version 0.4.0 introduced a breaking change.
You cannot set the pins in **begin()** any more.
This reduces the dependency of processor dependent Wire / I2C implementations.
The user has to call **Wire.begin()** and can optionally set the I2C pins 
before calling **begin()**.

## I2C Address

The I2C address of the ADS1113 /14 /15 is determined by to which pin 
the **ADDR** is connected to:

|  ADDR pin connected to  |  Address  |  Notes    |
|:-----------------------:|:---------:|:---------:|
|        GND              |   0x48    |  default  |
|        VDD              |   0x49    |           |
|        SDA              |   0x4A    |           |
|        SCL              |   0x4B    |           |


### I2C multiplexing

Sometimes you need to control more devices than possible with the default
address range the device provides.
This is possible with an I2C multiplexer e.g. TCA9548 which creates up 
to eight channels (think of it as I2C subnets) which can use the complete 
address range of the device. 

Drawback of using a multiplexer is that it takes more administration in 
your code e.g. which device is on which channel. 
This will slow down the access, which must be taken into account when
deciding which devices are on which channel.
Also note that switching between channels will slow down other devices 
too if they are behind the multiplexer.

## Interface

```cpp
#include "ADS1X15.h"
```

### Initializing

To initialize the library you must call a constructor as described below.

- **ADS1x15()** base constructor, should not be used.
- **ADS1013(uint8_t address, TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** Constructor with device address,
and optional the Wire interface as parameter.
- **ADS1014(uint8_t address, TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** Constructor with device address,
and optional the Wire interface as parameter.
- **ADS1015(uint8_t address, TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** Constructor with device address,
and optional the Wire interface as parameter.
- **ADS1113(uint8_t address, TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** Constructor with device address,
and optional the Wire interface as parameter.
- **ADS1114(uint8_t address, TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** Constructor with device address,
and optional the Wire interface as parameter.
- **ADS1115(uint8_t address, TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** Constructor with device address,
and optional the Wire interface as parameter.


After construction the **ADS.begin()** must be called, typical in **setup()**.

- **bool begin()** Returns false if an invalid address is used.
- **bool isConnected()** is used to check if the device address is visible on I2C.
- **void reset()** sets the internal parameters to their initial value as
in the constructor.

For example.

```cpp
  #include "ADS1X15.h"

  //  initialize ADS1115 on I2C bus 1 with default address 0x48
  ADS1115 ADS(0x48);

  void setup() 
  {
    if (!ADS.begin()) 
    {
      //  invalid address ADS1115 or 0x48 not found
    }
    if (!ADS.isConnected()) 
    {
      //  address 0x48 not found
    }
  }
```


### I2C clock speed

The function **void setWireClock(uint32_t speed = 100000)** is used to set the clock speed
in Hz of the used I2C interface. Typical value is 100 KHz.

The function **uint32_t getWireClock()** is a prototype.
It returns the value set by setWireClock().
This is not necessary the actual value.
When no value is set **getWireClock()** returns 0.
Need to implement a read / calculate from low level I2C code (e.g. TWBR on AVR),
better the Arduino Wire lib should support this call (ESP32 does).

See - https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues/11457

Question: Should this functionality be in this library?


### Programmable Gain

- **void setGain(uint8_t gain)** set the gain value, indicating the maxVoltage that can be measured
Adjusting the gain allowing to make more precise measurements.
Note: the gain is not set in the device until an explicit read/request of the ADC (any read call will do).
See table below.
- **uint8_t getGain()** returns the gain value (index).

|  PGA value  |  Max Voltage  |   Notes   |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|:---------:|
|      0      |    ±6.144V    |  default  |
|      1      |    ±4.096V    |           |
|      2      |    ±2.048V    |           |
|      4      |    ±1.024V    |           |
|      8      |    ±0.512V    |           |
|      16     |    ±0.256V    |           |


- **float getMaxVoltage()** returns the max voltage with the current gain.
- **float toVoltage(int16_t raw = 1)** converts a raw measurement to a voltage.
Can be used for normal and differential measurements.
The default value of 1 returns the conversion factor for any raw number.

The voltage factor can also be used to set HIGH and LOW threshold registers
with a voltage in the comparator mode.
Check the [examples](https://github.com/RobTillaart/ADS1X15/blob/master/examples/ADS_read_comparator_1/ADS_read_comparator_1.ino).

```cpp
  float f = ADS.toVoltage();
  ADS.setComparatorThresholdLow( 3.0 / f );
  ADS.setComparatorThresholdHigh( 4.3 / f );
```


### Operational mode

The ADS sensor can operate in single shot or continuous mode.
Depending on how often conversions needed you can tune the mode.

- **void setMode(uint8_t mode)** 0 = CONTINUOUS, 1 = SINGLE (default)
Note: the mode is not set in the device until an explicit read/request of the ADC (any read call will do).
- **uint8_t getMode()** returns current mode 0 or 1, or ADS1X15_INVALID_MODE = 0xFE.


### Data rate

- **void setDataRate(uint8_t dataRate)** Data rate depends on type of device.
For all devices the index 0..7 can be used, see table below.
Values above 7 ==> will be set to the default 4.
Note: the data rate is not set in the device until an explicit read/request of the ADC (any read call will do).
- **uint8_t getDataRate()** returns the current data rate (index).

The library has no means to convert this index to the actual numbers
as that would take 32 bytes.

Data rate in samples per second, based on datasheet is described on table below.

|  data rate  |  ADS101x  |  ADS111x  |   Notes   |
|:-----------:|----------:|----------:|:---------:|
|     0       |   128     |    8      |  slowest  |
|     1       |   250     |    16     |           |
|     2       |   490     |    32     |           |
|     3       |   920     |    64     |           |
|     4       |   1600    |    128    |  default  |
|     5       |   2400    |    250    |           |
|     6       |   3300    |    475    |           |
|     7       |   3300    |    860    |  fastest  |


### ReadADC Single mode

Reading the ADC is very straightforward, the **readADC()** function handles all in one call.
Under the hood it uses the asynchronous calls.

- **int16_t readADC(uint8_t pin = 0)** normal ADC functionality, pin = 0..3.
If the pin number is out of range, this function will return 0 (seems safest).
Default pin = 0 as this is convenient for the single channel devices.

```cpp
  //  read ADC in pin 2
  ADS.readADC(2);

  //  read ADC in pin 0 - two ways
  ADS.readADC();
  ADS.readADC(0);
```


See [examples](https://github.com/RobTillaart/ADS1X15/blob/master/examples/ADS_minimum/ADS_minimum.ino).

The **readADC()** can return **ADS1X15_ERROR_TIMEOUT (-101)** which is an errorcode.
This may conflict with a possible actual value of -101. 
Therefore the user should check with **getError()** if an error has occurred after reading the ADC.

```cpp
   Value = ADS.readADC()
   if (ADS.getError() == ADS1X15_OK)
      //  Use value
   else
      //  handle error
```

The errorhandling within the library need to be improved, see also issue #84.


### Read the ADC in asynchronous way

To read the ADC in an asynchronous way (e.g. to minimize blocking) you need call three functions:

- **void requestADC(uint8_t pin = 0)**  Start the conversion. pin = 0..3.
Default pin = 0 as this is convenient for 1 channel devices.
- **bool isBusy()** Is the conversion not ready yet? Works only in SINGLE mode!
- **bool isReady()** Is the conversion ready? Works only in SINGLE mode!  (= wrapper around **isBusy()** )
- **int16_t getValue()** Read the result of the conversion.


in terms of code:

```cpp
  void setup()
  {
    //  other setup things here
    ADS.setMode(1);               //  SINGLE SHOT MODE
    ADS.requestADC(pin);
  }

  void loop()
  {
    if (ADS.isReady())
    {
      value = ADS.getValue();
      ADS.requestADC(pin);       //  request new conversion
    }
    //  do other things here
  }
```
See [examples](https://github.com/RobTillaart/ADS1X15/blob/master/examples/ADS_read_async/ADS_read_async.ino).


### ReadADC Differential

For reading the ADC in a differential way there are 4 calls possible.

- **int16_t readADC_Differential_0_1()** returns the difference between 2 ADC pins.
- **int16_t readADC_Differential_0_3()** ADS1x15 only
- **int16_t readADC_Differential_1_3()** ADS1x15 only
- **int16_t readADC_Differential_2_3()** ADS1x15 only
- **int16_t readADC_Differential_0_2()** ADS1x15 only - in software (no async equivalent)
- **int16_t readADC_Differential_1_2()** ADS1x15 only - in software (no async equivalent)

```cpp
  //  read differential ADC between pin 0 and 1
  ADS.readADC_Differential_0_1(0);
```

The differential reading of the ADC can also be done with asynchronous calls.

- **void requestADC_Differential_0_1()** starts conversion for differential reading
- **void requestADC_Differential_0_3()** ADS1x15 only
- **void requestADC_Differential_1_3()** ADS1x15 only
- **void requestADC_Differential_2_3()** ADS1x15 only

After one of these calls you need to call
- **int16_t getValue()** Read the result of the last conversion.

See [examples](https://github.com/RobTillaart/ADS1X15/blob/master/examples/ADS_differential/ADS_differential.ino).


### lastRequestMode

Since 0.3.12 the library tracks the last request mode, single pin or differential.
This variable is set at the moment of request, and keeps its value until a new 
request is made. This implies that the value / request can be quite old.

Values >= 0x10 are differential, values < 0x10 are single pin. 

- **uint8_t lastRequest()** returns one of the values below.

|  Value  |  Description                 |  Notes  |
|:-------:|:-----------------------------|:--------|
|  0xFF   |  no (invalid) request made   |  after call constructor.
|  0x00   |  single pin 0                |
|  0x01   |  single pin 1                |
|  0x02   |  single pin 2                |
|  0x03   |  single pin 3                |
|  0x10   |  differential pin 1 0        |
|  0x30   |  differential pin 3 0        |
|  0x31   |  differential pin 3 1        |
|  0x32   |  differential pin 3 2        |


Please note that (for now) the function does not support a descriptive return value
for the following two requests:
- **readADC_Differential_0_2()** ADS1x15 only - in software (no async equivalent)
- **readADC_Differential_1_2()** ADS1x15 only - in software (no async equivalent)

As these are emulated in software by two single pin calls, the state would be 
one of the two single pin values.


### ReadADC continuous mode

To use the continuous mode you need call three functions:

- **void setMode(0)** 0 = CONTINUOUS, 1 = SINGLE (default).
Note: the mode is not set in the device until an explicit read/request of the ADC (any read call will do).
- **int16_t readADC(uint8_t pin)** or **void requestADC(uint8_t pin)** to get the continuous mode started.
- **int16_t getValue()** to return the last value read by the device.
Note this can be a different pin, so be warned.
Calling this over and over again can give the same value multiple times.

```cpp
  void setup() 
  {
    //  configuration things here
    ADS.setMode(ADS.MODE_CONTINUOUS);
    ADS.requestADC(0);              //  request on pin 0
  }

  void loop()
  {
    value = ADS.getValue()
    sleep(1)
  }
```

See [examples](https://github.com/RobTillaart/ADS1X15/blob/master/examples/ADS_continuous/ADS_continuous.ino)
.
By using **bool isBusy()** or **bool isReady()** one can wait until new data is available.
Note this only works in the SINGLE_SHOT modus.

In continuous mode, you can't use **isBusy()** or **isReady()** functions to wait until new data available.
Instead you can configure the threshold registers to allow the **ALERT/RDY**
pin to trigger an interrupt signal when conversion data ready.


### Switching mode or channel during continuous mode

When switching the operating mode or the ADC channel in continuous mode, be aware that 
the device will always finish the running conversion.
This implies that after switching the mode or channel the first sample you get is probably 
the last sample with the previous settings, e.g. channel.
This might be a problem for your project as this value can be in an "unexpected" range (outlier).

The robust way to change mode or channel therefore seems to be:

1. stop continuous mode,
1. wait for running conversion to be ready,
1. reject the last conversion or process it "under old settings",
1. change the settings,
1. restart (continuous mode) with the new settings.

This explicit stop takes extra time, however it should prevent "incorrect" readings.

(need to be verified with different models)


### Threshold registers

(datasheet 9.3.8)  
_Conversion Ready Pin (ADS1114 and ADS1115 Only)
The ALERT/RDY pin can also be configured as a conversion ready pin. Set the most-significant bit of the
Hi_thresh register to 1 and the most-significant bit of Lo_thresh register to 0 to enable the pin as a conversion
ready pin._


If the thresholdHigh is set to 0x8000 and the thresholdLow to 0x0000
the **ALERT/RDY** pin is triggered when a conversion is ready.

- **void setComparatorThresholdLow(int16_t lo)** writes value to device directly.
- **void setComparatorThresholdHigh(int16_t hi)** writes value to device directly.
- **int16_t getComparatorThresholdLow()** reads value from device.
- **int16_t getComparatorThresholdHigh()** reads value from device.

See [examples](https://github.com/RobTillaart/ADS1X15/blob/master/examples/ADS_read_RDY/ADS_read_RDY.ino).


### Comparator

Please read Page 15 of the datasheet as the behaviour of the
comparator is not trivial.

NOTE: all comparator settings are copied to the device only after calling
**readADC()** or **requestADC()** functions.


### Comparator Mode

When configured as a **TRADITIONAL** comparator, the **ALERT/RDY** pin asserts
(active low by default) when conversion data exceed the limit set in the
high threshold register. The comparator then de-asserts when the input
signal falls below the low threshold register value.

- **void setComparatorMode(uint8_t mode)** value 0 = TRADITIONAL 1 = WINDOW,
- **uint8_t getComparatorMode()** returns value set.


If the comparator **LATCH** is set, the **ALERT/RDY** pin asserts and it will be
reset after reading the sensor (conversion register) again.
*An SMB alert command (00011001) on the I2C bus will also reset the alert state.*
*Not implemented in the library (yet)*

In **WINDOW** comparator mode, the **ALERT/RDY** pin asserts if conversion data exceeds
the high threshold register or falls below the low threshold register.
In this mode the alert is held if the **LATCH** is set. This is similar as above.


### Polarity

Default state of the **ALERT/RDY** pin is **LOW**, which can be to set **HIGH**.

- **void setComparatorPolarity(uint8_t pol)**
Flag is only explicitly set after a **readADC()** or a **requestADC()**
- **uint8_t getComparatorPolarity()** returns value set.


From tests (see #76) it became clear that the behaviour of the **ALERT/RDY** pin 
looks ambiguous. Further investigation eventually showed that the behaviour is 
logical but one should not think in "pulses", more in levels and edges.

In the continuous mode it looks like an 8us pulse, however this "pulse" is
actual a short time (8 us) of IDLE followed by a long time pulse of converting.

In the single shot mode it looks like the converting time is the pulse
as that is the only single change visible. This is IMHO the correct view.


#### ALERT RDY table

|  MODE          |  COMP_POL  |  IDLE  |  START    |  CONVERT  |   READY   |
|:---------------|:-----------|:-------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| 0 = continuous |  0 = LOW   |  HIGH  |  FALLING  |  LOW      |  RISING   |
| 0 = continuous |  1 = HIGH  |  LOW   |  RISING   |  HIGH     |  FALLING  |
| 1 = single     |  0 = LOW   |  HIGH  |  FALLING  |  LOW      |  RISING   |
| 1 = single     |  1 = HIGH  |  LOW   |  RISING   |  HIGH     |  FALLING  |


See issue #76 for some screenshots.


#### Converting time by Data Rate

|  data rate  |  convert time  |  Notes  |
|:-----------:|:--------------:|:-------:|
|      0      |     125 ms     |
|      1      |      62 ms     |
|      2      |      32 ms     |
|      3      |      16 ms     |
|      4      |       8 ms     |  default, see in table above.
|      5      |     4.4 ms     |
|      6      |     2.4 ms     |
|      7      |     1.2 ms     |

Times are estimates from scope.


#### Conclusions

- Conversion generates a conversion pulse with length depending on the data rate.
- In continuous mode it looks like there is a short pulse, but actual the long
  period is the conversion pulse. 

In short:

- if COMP_POL = 0, 
  - a FALLING edge indicates conversion start.
  - a LOW level indicates converting.
  - a RISING edge indicates conversion ready.
  - a HIGH level indicates idle.
 
- if COMP_POL = 1, 
  - a RISING edge indicates conversion start.
  - a HIGH level indicates converting.
  - a FALLING edge indicates conversion ready.
  - a LOW level indicates idle.

This interpretation is in line with all tests done in #76.


### Latch

Holds the **ALERT/RDY** to **HIGH** (or **LOW** depending on polarity) after triggered
even if actual value has been 'restored to normal' value.

- **void setComparatorLatch(uint8_t latch)** 0 = NO LATCH, not 0 = LATCH
- **uint8_t getComparatorLatch()** returns value set.

The (no-)latch is not verified in detail yet.


### QueConvert

Set the number of conversions before trigger activates.

The **void setComparatorQueConvert(uint8_t mode)** is used to set the number of
conversions that exceed the threshold before the **ALERT/RDY** pin is set **HIGH**.
A value of 3 (or above) effectively disables the comparator. See table below. 

See [examples](https://github.com/RobTillaart/ADS1X15/blob/master/examples/ADS_continuous_differential/ADS_continuous_differential.ino).

- **void setComparatorQueConvert(uint8_t mode)** See table below.
- **uint8_t getComparatorQueConvert()**  returns the value set.

|  value  |  meaning                            |  Notes    |
|:-------:|:------------------------------------|:----------|
|    0    |  trigger alert after 1 conversion   |           |
|    1    |  trigger alert after 2 conversions  |           |
|    2    |  trigger alert after 4 conversions  |           |
|    3    |  Disable comparator                 |  default  |
|  other  |  Disable comparator                 |           |

To enable the conversion-ready function of the **ALERT/RDY** pin, 
it is necessary to set the MSB of the Hi_threshold register to 1 (value 0x8000)
and the MSB of the Lo_threshold register to 0.
See section **Threshold registers** above.


### Threshold registers comparator mode

Depending on the comparator mode **TRADITIONAL** or **WINDOW** the thresholds registers
mean something different see - Comparator Mode above or datasheet.

- **void setComparatorThresholdLow(int16_t lo)** set the low threshold; take care the hi >= lo.
- **void setComparatorThresholdHigh(int16_t hi)**  set the high threshold; take care the hi >= lo.
- **int16_t getComparatorThresholdLow()** reads value from device.
- **int16_t getComparatorThresholdHigh()** reads value from device.


## Error codes

This section has to be elaborated.

Some functions return or set an error value.
This is read and reset by **getError()** 

|  Value  |  Define                   |  Description  |
|:-------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------:|
|      0  |  ADS1X15_OK               | idem.
|   -100  |  ADS1X15_INVALID_VOLTAGE  | getMaxVoltage()
|   -101  |  ADS1X15_ERROR_TIMEOUT    | readADC() device did not respond in time.
|   -102  |  ADS1X15_ERROR_I2C        | I2C communication failure.
|   0xFF  |  ADS1X15_INVALID_GAIN     | getGain() 
|   0xFE  |  ADS1X15_INVALID_MODE     | getMode()


## Future ideas & improvements

#### Must

- Improve documentation (always)
  - split off separate topics?

#### Should

- Remove the experimental **getWireClock()** as this is not really a library function
  but a responsibility of the I2C library.
- Investigate ADS1118 library which should be a similar SPI based ADC.
- improve error handling
  - refactor values to be more logic.

#### Could

- SMB alert command (00011001) on I2C bus?
- Sync code order .h / .cpp

#### Wont (unless requested)

- Type flag?
- Constructor for ADS1X15? No as all types are supported.
