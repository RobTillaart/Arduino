# AMT25

Arduino library for SPI based AMT25 series rotary encoder.


### Description

**Experimental**

**Warning:** This library is not tested with hardware yet.
So use with care, feedback welcome.

AMT25 is a library for the **AMT253D-V** and compatible rotation encoders.
This devices decodes 360.0째 in 4096 (12 bits) or 16384 steps (14 bits)
which implies an accuracy of about 0.088째 or even 0.022째.

TODO elaborate.



### Compatibles

Families of AMT2x series rotary encoder devices with other interfaces.

|  device  |  protocol  |  compat  |  notes  |
|:--------:|:----------:|:--------:|:--------|
|  AMT21   |   RS485    |    x     |
|  AMT22   |    SPI     |   YYY    |
|  AMT23   |  3-Wire    |    ?     |  Simpler, SPI alike, investigate
|  AMT24   |   RS485    |    x     |
|  AMT25   |    SPI     |   YYY    |

So far the AMT22 family looks compatible and the AMT23 family might.
TODO investigate.

Please note that from the **AMT25xy-V** there are 8 variations.
See [datasheet](https://www.sameskydevices.com/product/resource/amt25.pdf)
for all details:
- x = Orientation: 2 = Radial (right angle), 3 = Axial (straight)
- y = Absolute Resolution:
  - A = 12-bit single-turn, B = 14-bit single-turn
  - C = 12-bit multi-turn,  D = 14-bit multi-turn

Not all variations are tested.

### Please report your experiences.

If you have a AMT25 device, please let me know your experiences
with the sensor and this (or other) library.


## Interface

```cpp
#include "AMT25.h"
```

### Constructor

- **AMT25(uint8_t select, __SPI_CLASS__ \* mySPI = &SPI)** HARDWARE SPI
- **AMT25(uint8_t select, uint8_t dataIn, uint8_t dataOut, uint8_t clock)** SOFTWARE SPI
- **bool begin(uint8_t bits = 14)** initializes the communication, set number of bits.

AMT22 and AMT23 derived classes have same constructors.


### Read

- **uint16_t getRawValue()** returns a value from 0..16383
- **float getAngle()** returns an absolute angle from 0..360.0째, optional
with offset correction.
- **void setOffset(float offset = 0)** set an offset in degrees for the angle.
- **float getOffset()** returns the current offset in degrees.
- **uint16_t setZero()** set current position as zero.
- **uint16_t getTurns()** get number of turns.
- **uint32_t lastRead()** timestamp in microseconds since start.
Note this wraps every ~70 minutes however for RPM measurements one
need to read the device far more often.


### SPI

- **void setSPIspeed(uint32_t speed)** idem, clipped to max 2 MHz.
- **uint32_t getSPIspeed()** idem.
- **bool usesHWSPI()** idem.


## Future

#### Must

- improve documentation
- test with hardware

#### Should

- test compatibility ANT22 / AMT23

#### Could

- add examples
- add convenience getter for steps / bits

#### Wont
