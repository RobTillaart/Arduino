# AsyncAnalog

Arduino Library for async reading of an analogue pin. **\[AVR ONLY\]**.


## Description

AsyncAnalog is a library to read the analogue port of an **AVR** in an asynchronous way.
This means that the user must explicitly **start()** the ADC, check if it is **ready()**
and read its **value()**.

By using this class, the user prevents the (~112 uSec) blocking of the 
**analogRead()** call, and gives the user the ability to do some processing.

The library works only for AVR boards now, other platforms might be supported in the future.
(PR's are welcome).

**WARNING**
As the UNO has only one ADC that is multiplexed, one can only read one analog pin
in async way simultaneously. Still it offers to about 100 micros to do something!

**Use with care**

## Interface

```cpp
#include "AsynAnalog,h"
```

### Constructor

- **AsyncAnalog(uint8_t pin)** constructor, defines the analogue pin to use.

### Async API

- **void start()** triggers a new ADC measurement.
- **bool ready()** Checks if the measurement is completed. 
If so the value is calculated and cached for **value()**.
As long as ready() is not called the old value will not change!
- **uint16_t value()** returns the value of the ADC from cache.
So it will return the same value even if the internal ADC is used to sample
another analog port.


## Operation

The example **asyncAnalogTest2.ino** shows a loop of 1000 analogReads and prints 
over Serial at 115200 baud. 


## Future

#### Must

- improve documentation.

#### Should

- create examples
  - real world examples preferred.
  - multi ADC, e.g. A0..A4


#### Could

- investigate the performance gain.
  - asyncAnalogTest2.ino is not a good test.
- investigate other platforms
- fall back to normal analogRead for non AVR platforms ?
  - start would be analogRead() and it would immediately be ready and the value is cached.
  - better have specific code per platform.

#### Wont
