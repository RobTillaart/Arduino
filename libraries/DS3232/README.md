# DS3232

Arduino library for I2C DS3232 real time clock and compatibles.


## Description

This DS3232 library provides a minimalistic interface to read and write the date 
and time to and from the I2C DS3232 RTC device and compatibles.

What is different from other RTC libraries is that it directly provides fields like
seconds, minutes etc. and not use ``` time structs``` from libraries like 
```time.h``` or ```timelib.h```. This has its pros and cons of course.
Goal is to improve the ease of use for those who just need the date and time elements
and not use the alarms etc.

Furthermore the library only supports the 24 hour per day model to minimize footprint.
Subtracting 12 hours is not too difficult if one wants an "AM/PM" layout.

The current version does not support any special feature other than two generic
**readRegister()** and **writeRegister()** functions.
These two functions allows users access to all registers and to do anything possible.
However for people who need a full function DS3232 library check the excellent 
library at https://github.com/JChristensen/DS3232RTC


Note: This DS3232 library is a refactored version of an old experimental DS3232 library 
from 2011 which was never published.


#### Tests

All 0.4.0 examples are tested with Arduino UNO with 100KHz I2C.


#### Compatibles

The DS3231 RTC is compatible for the date and time keeping part.
The only difference found is that the DS3231 does not have the 
236 bytes of **battery back-upped** SRAM the DS3232 has.

## Hardware

Always check datasheet for connections.

Pull ups are needed on SDA, SCL and other pins (datasheet).


## I2C 

#### Performance

I2C bus speeds officially supports up to 400 KHz.

Timing of UNO with DS3232 of **read()** in microseconds.

|  board   |  speed   |  time  |  notes  |
|:--------:|:--------:|:------:|:-------:|
|   UNO    |   50000  |  2011  |
|   UNO    |  100000  |  1072  |
|   UNO    |  200000  |   608  |
|   UNO    |  300000  |   442  |
|   UNO    |  400000  |   374  |  max official supported 
|   UNO    |  500000  |   328  |  indicative
|   UNO    |  600000  |   296  |  indicative
|   UNO    |  700000  |   280  |  indicative
|   UNO    |  800000  |   272  |  indicative

Note that the performance can be increased a lot by keeping track 
of the lastRead(). See example **DS3232_demo_read_minute.ino**
An indication averaged around 44us per update on UNO.


#### Address

Fixed address 0x68, both for DS3232 and DS3231, see datasheet

#### I2C multiplexing

Imagine you want multiple clocks e.g. for different time zones.
Or just to average them to be more precise, or as backup of each other
so even swapping batteries can be done without loss of availability.

Sometimes you need to control more devices than possible with the default
address range the device provides.
This is possible with an I2C multiplexer e.g. TCA9548 which creates up 
to eight channels (think of it as I2C subnets) which can use the complete 
address range of the device. 

Drawback of using a multiplexer is that it takes more administration in 
your code e.g. which device is on which channel. 
This will slow down the access, which must be taken into account when
deciding which devices are on which channel.
Also note that switching between channels will slow down other devices 
too if they are behind the multiplexer.

## Interface

```cpp
#include "DS3232.h"
```

#### Constructor

- **DS3231(TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** Constructor and I2C bus.
- **DS3232(TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** Constructor and I2C bus.
- **int begin()** initializes internals.
Returns error status.
- **bool isConnected()** checks if address (0x68) can be seen on the I2C bus.
- **uint8_t getAddress()** returns address (0x68) set in constructor.
- **uint16_t getType()** returns 3232 or 3231, depending on constructor.

#### Base RTC

- **int read()** read the current time from the RTC.
- **int write()** set the current time in the RTC.
Writes all fields, be aware that weekDay need to be set too.
- **uint32_t lastRead()** lastTime in milliseconds when RTC is read.

#### Getters

Getters return the last read value, to update call **read()** first.

- **uint8_t seconds()**
- **uint8_t minutes()**
- **uint8_t hours()**
- **uint8_t weekDay()**
- **uint8_t day()**
- **uint8_t month()**
- **uint8_t year()**

#### Setters

Setters set a value, to update the RTC call **write()** after.

- **void setSeconds(uint8_t value)** 0..59
- **void setMinutes(uint8_t value)** 0..59
- **void setHours(uint8_t value)** 0..23
- **void setWeekDay(uint8_t value)** 1..7  1 = Monday .. 7 = Sunday
- **void setDay(uint8_t value)** 1..31
- **void setMonth(uint8_t value)** 1..12
- **void setYear(uint8_t value)** 0..99

Note: you can also adjust just one field and keep the others.


#### Temperature

Note that the temperature measurement is only refreshed every 64 (default),
128, 256 or 512 seconds.
The interval can be set with bits 5 and 4 of the CONTROL/STATUS register (0x0F).

- **float getTemperature()** return temperature in 0.25Â°C steps.


#### Low level: Read/WriteRegister

Allows to access all functionality the library did not implement (yet).
Check datasheet for details per register.
Use with care.

- **int readRegister(uint8_t reg)**
- **int writeRegister(uint8_t reg, uint8_t value)**


#### Debug

In case of an I2C error one can get the last return value 
of ```wire.EndTransmission()``` to get an indication of the problem.

- **int lastRv()** values depend on platform used.


## DS3232 SRAM 

Experimental SRAM support, needs to be tested / verified.  
Feedback welcome.

SRAM is DS3232 specific, and it has 236 bytes.
The following functions use index 0..235. The user should guard 
the index esp. for the 16 and 32 bit versions as it is not checked.

236 bytes can be used e.g. to hold 78 hms timestamps

- **int SRAMwrite8(uint8_t index, uint8_t value)**
- **int SRAMwrite16(uint8_t index, uint16_t value)**
- **int SRAMwrite32(uint8_t index, uint32_t value)**
- **uint8_t SRAMread8(uint8_t index)**
- **uint16_t SRAMread16(uint8_t index)**
- **uint32_t SRAMread32(uint8_t index)**


## Notes

#### Day of week

DS3232 datasheet states:
_The day-of-week register increments at midnight.
Values that correspond to the day of week are **user defined** but must be 
sequential (i.e., if 1 equals Sunday, then 2 equals Monday, and so on). 
Illogical time and date entries result in undefined operation._

- https://forum.arduino.cc/t/got-time-from-ntp-server-need-day-of-week/117799/6

Gives some insight about the weekday encoding from another perspective explaining
why 0 == Thursday. Epoch (1-1-1970) is a Thursday.


## Future

Idea: use the DS3231 as the small footprint version
and allow the DS3232 to support all functionality.

#### Must

- improve documentation.

#### Should

- test platforms
- test performance / footprint
- can the trick from the example be included in the library?
  - extra footprint?
- test SRAM with a DS3232 (need hardware)

#### Could

- add readDate() + readTime()
  - less IO
  - as date is not read so often.

DS3232 derived class SRAM - test
- int SRAMwriteFloat(uint8_t index, uint8_t value);
- float SRAMreadFloat(uint8_t index);
- float and char array support?  Template T;
- optimize SRAM read and write functions (performance)
  - writeRegister(idx, buf, size)


#### Wont

Other extended functionality (or in derived class)
- void startRTC();
- void stopRTC();
- bool isRunningRTC();
- void setSQWMode(uint8_t);  //  0..3 ??
- alarm 1 & 2, same reg array?
- RESET pin input and output
- AM/PM mode not supported, user can handle this easily
  - bool is24Mode();
  - void set24Mode();
  - void set12Mode();
