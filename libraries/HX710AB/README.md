# HX710AB

Arduino library for the HX710A and HX710B 24-Bit ADC.


## Description

**Experimental**

This library provides two classes to read the HX710A and the HX710B ADC.

(from datasheet)

_The HX710(A/B) is a precision 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with built-in
temperature sensor (HX710A) or DVDD, AVDD voltage difference detection (HX710B). 
Itâ€™s designed for weigh scales and industrial control applications to interface 
directly with a bridge sensor._

The HX710A can read the internal temperature.

THe HX710B can read the DVDD and AVDD supply voltage difference.

The HX710 has no means to detect errors, however several readings without noise
especially zero's might be an indication that something is wrong.

THe HX710 is closely related to the HX711 which has more features.
These are not 1-to-1 replaceble devices.


### Performance

Performance depends on platform used and on the time to make a measurment.
The latter is either 10 or 40 Hz, which possibly means optional 100 or 25 
milliseconds extra waiting time. (needs investigations)

### Test

TODO: Test with hardware.


## Interface

```cpp
#include "HX710AB.h"
```

### Constructor

- **HX710A(uint8_t dataPin, uint8_t clockPin)** constructor.
- **HX710B(uint8_t dataPin, uint8_t clockPin)** constructor.
- **void begin(bool fastProcessor = false)** initialises pins.
The fastProcessor option adds a 1 uS delay for each clock half-cycle 
to keep the time greater than 200 nS.

### Read

- **int32_t read(bool differential = true)** powers up the device,
reads from the device, sets the mode for the **next** read.
The default parameter is true as differential readings are most used.
See table below. 

|  differential  |  HX710A         |  HX710B         |  notes    |
|:--------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------:|
|   true         |  differential   |  differential   |  default  |
|   false        |  temperature    |  DVDD and AVDD  |


- **uint32_t lastTimeRead()** returns last time a value was read in milliseconds.
- **int32_t lastValueRead()** returns last read value, note this can be
differential or other. The user should keep track of this.


### Power

- **void powerDown()** puts the device in sleep mode (after 60 us).
- **void powerUp()** wakes up device.

Note the **read()** function automatically wakes up the device.


## Future

#### Must

- get hardware to test  (at least HX710B pressure)
- improve documentation

#### Should

- investigate blocking time read()
  - async interface to circumvent the blocking wait.
  - bool request();    //  wakes up device
  - bool dataReady();  //  dataline check
  - int32_t fetch(differential = true);  //  actual fetch

#### Could

- calibration somehow.
  - converting to units / temperature  (See HX711)
  - tare() + scale() ?
  - zero reading ?
- refactor class hierarchy
- extend unit tests(?)
- more examples.
- extend performance test sketch
- AVR optimized code - see FastShiftIn.

#### Wont

- bool isPowerUp();  //  needed?
- void powerUp() not needed, as read does this.
