/**
 * @brief This is a utility class for using an eeprom to store a simple
 * data structure.
 * 
 * The purpose of the utility is to extend the life of an eeprom memory by
 * rotating the writes over different pages to reduce the number of writes
 * to any individual page.
 * It does this by partitioning the memory into slots (of continuous pages)
 * big enough to contain the data structure. When data is written to a slot
 * it is given a header with a
 * version number.
 * On initialization the slots are scanned for the one with the highest
 * version number which is then used for subsequent reads.
 * Whenever data is written the version number is incremented and the next
 * slot in sequence is used (or the first slot if going past the end).
 *  
 * Note that the data is stored in binary form which means it should not be
 * expected that the eeprom can be moved between architectures. Data stored
 * in an eeprom will also become invalid if the data structure is changed
 * either manually or due to changed optimization settings.
 *
 * If the data structure has changed or if the eeprom contains other data it
 * must first be formatted with a call to format().
 * 
 * Finally, since the version number is a long word, this class will
 * *derail and fail* to add new versions past 4294967295 writes.
 * 
 * @tparam T the type of the data structure to store, should only contain
 * **value** members and no constructor/destructor nor other
 * methods/functions - e g a pure DTO.
