# Kurtosis

Arduino library for calculating skewness and kurtosis of a dataset  (statistics).


## Description

**Experimental**

This library was written after a request how to calculate the kurtosis of a histogram.
Diving into this question I learned Kurtosis is a statistical metric, somewhat 
related to the skewness ("is balanced") of that data set.
The goal or kurtosis is to detect outliers (as far as I understand) in the data set.

Not a statistician by profession, I searched the internet and found several sources 
that described the kurtosis measurement.
There appear to be multiple methods to determine the kurtosis of a data set, so there 
appears no agreed standard (see Wikipedia).

The code of this library is based upon the code of **John D. Cook** in the blog named 
"Computing skewness and kurtosis in one pass". Thanks for his kind permission!
See - https://www.johndcook.com/blog/skewness_kurtosis/


I adapted the code on a few places to improve performance a bit.
Furthermore I named the library Kurtosis as calculating that metric is the 
prime purpose of this library.

For a deep technical reader about kurtosis and skewness I refer to the Wikipedia.

Links to other information are welcome.

The code is not well tested or verified so use with care.

## Performance

Time in us, platform UNO, 

0.0.0 is non optimized version.

|  function  |  0.0.0  |  0.1.0  |  0.1.1  |  Notes  |
|:----------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|  add       |   232   |  213.7  |  211.6  |  averaged 1000 calls
|  variance  |    -    |    44   |    48   |  accuracy of UNO is 4 us.
|  skewness  |   416   |   352   |   356   |
|  kurtosis  |    -    |    64   |    64   |


## Interface

```cpp
#include "Kurtosis.h"
```

#### Base

- **Kurtosis()** create the Kurtosis object.
- **void reset()** resets the internal variables.

#### Core

- **void add(double x)** add new value to the internal variables.
- **uint32_t count()** returns the amount of values added.
- **double mean()** returns the mean (or average) of the values added. 
This function will return 0 if no values have been added, or after reset().
- **double variance()** idem.
Note this value is cached as **stddev()** uses it too. 
So the performance of two consecutive calls differ in duration.
- **double stddev()** standard deviation.
- **double skewness()** returns skewness ("balanced"), negative values indicate left skew, 
positive values indicate right skew. See Wikipedia for details.
- **double kurtosis()** returns the kurtosis, "tailedness" is used e.g. to detect outliers.
See Wikipedia for details.

#### Operators

For adding distributions.

- **operator +** add two Kurtosis objects together.
- **operator +=** add a Kurtosis objects to this one.

#### debug / development

- **void dump()** dumps the internal variables to Serial.


## Future

#### Must

- improve documentation.
- understand the metrics and math in far more detail.

#### Should

- add examples to explain the purpose.
- extend unit tests.
- ask the experts
- investigate the order of adding on the metrics.

#### Could

- cache skewness and kurtosis? useful?
- Template class so one can choose float or double.

#### Wont
