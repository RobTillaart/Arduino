# MultiMap

Arduino library for fast non-linear mapping or interpolation of values.


## Description

In Arduino applications often the 'raw' value of a sensor is mapped upon a more
usable value. E.g. the value of analogRead() 0 .. 1023 is mapped onto 0 .. 5.0 Volt.
This is often done by the **map()** function which does a linear interpolation 
with integer truncating.

This means in code:

```cpp
    output = C1 + input * C2
```

As C1 and C2 are to be determined, Arduino has the **map()** function that calculates the 
two variables runtime from two given mapping points (I1, O1) and (I2, O2).

```cpp
    output = map(input, I1, I2, O1, O2):
```

In many cases when there is no linear mapping possible as the 'points' are not 
on a single straight line. Think a logarithmic or some sine wave form.
To solve this one needs non-linear math to calculate the output from a given input.

The **multiMap()** function simulates this math by approximating the non-linear function with multiple
linear line segments. 
Of course this approximation introduces an error. 
By increasing the number of points and choose their position strategically the average error 
can and will be reduced. 
An important feature of the **multiMap()** is that the points do not need to have the same 
distance (non-equidistant). This allows to have more pointe where needed (curvy line) and 
less point where possible (straight lines).

Note: some functions are hard to approximate even with **multiMap()** as they go to infinity 
or have a singularity.
Think of **tan(x)** around x = PI/2 (90Â°) or **sin(1/x)** around zero.

The function to approximate must be (mathematically) an injection. 
This means that for every input value (in the given range) there is an output value. 
However there might be more than one input value mapping onto the same output value.

## Interface

```cpp
#include "MultiMap.h"
```


### Usage

The basic call for **multiMap()** is:

```cpp
output = Multimap<datatype>(input, inputArray, outputArray, size);
```

**multiMap()** needs two equally sized arrays representing the reference 'points' named 
**inputArray\[\]** and **outputArray\[\]** both of the **datatype**.

**multiMap()** will do a lookup of the input value in the **inputArray\[\]**.
If it cannot find the index of an exact point it will determine a weighted position between two points.
This optional weighted point is used to interpolate a value from the data in the **outputArray\[\]**.

- The **inputArray\[\]** must have increasing values, 
there is no such restriction for the **output\[\]** array.
- The values of the **inputArray\[\]** do not need to have the same distance (non-equidistant).
E.g a sort of logarithmic input array like { 1, 10, 100, 1000 } is valid.
- **multiMap()** automatically constrains the output to the first and last value in the **outputArray\[\]**.
This is a explicit difference with the **map()** function.
Therefore it is important to extend the range of the arrays to cover all possible input and output values.


## Performance

The **multiMap()** function does a linear search for the inputValue in the **inputArray\[\]**.
This implies that usage of larger and more precise arrays will take more time.
Furthermore "low" input values will be found faster than "high" values, so the function
has no constant time execution.

To optimize performance a binary search version exists, see **multiMapBS()** below. 

As every usage of **multiMap()** is unique one should always do a performance check to see
if there is a substantial gain in the case at hand. In my experience there often is.


### MultiMapBS

Experimental 0.1.7 => use with care.

**multiMapBS()** stands for MultiMapBinarySearch or MMBS for short.
It is a very similar function as **multiMap()** with the same interface.
The main difference is that MMBS uses binary search instead of linear search.

Performance tests indicate that for array sizes of about 10 elements, 
the **multiMapBS()** is on par with **multiMap()**. 
This is an expected value as both need on average about 5 steps to find 
the right interval to interpolate.

Be sure to do your own tests to see if MMBS improves your performance.


### MultiMapCache

Experimental 0.1.7 => use with care.

**multiMapCache()** or MMC for short, is a very similar function as **multiMap()**.
The main difference is that MMC caches the last input and output value.
The goal is to improve the performance by preventing searching a repeating input
value over and over again.

If the input sequence has a lot of repeating values e.g. 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 2
MMC will be able to return the value from cache often. 
Otherwise keeping cache is overhead.

Be sure to do your own tests to see if MMC improves your performance.

A possible variation is to cache the last interval - lower and upper index.
It would allow a to test that value and improve the linear search.
(not implemented, to be investigated).


### MultiMap two types

Experimental 0.2.0 => use with care.

**multiMap<T1, T2>()** or MMTT for short, is a very similar function as **multiMap()**.
The main difference is that MMTT uses two different types, typical the input 
is an integer type and the output is a float or double type.
It is expected that there will be a gain if two different sized integer types are used.
So performance is platform specific.

See the example **multimap_distance_two_types.ino**

```cpp
//  for a sharp distance range finder (based upon graph datasheet).
float sharp2cm2(int value)
{
  // out[] holds the distances in cm
  float out[] = {150, 140, 130, 120, 110, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20};

  // in[] holds the measured analogRead() values for that distance
  int in[]  = { 90, 97, 105, 113, 124, 134, 147, 164, 185, 218, 255, 317, 408, 506};

  float distance = multiMap<int, float>(value, in, out, 14);
  return distance;
}
```

First tests indicate that using the int type for the input in the example
is substantial (~37%) faster per call. Tested on UNO R3, time in micros per call.

|  types  |  time us  |  call  |
|:-------:|:---------:|:-------|
|    1    |  194.93   |  ```float dist = multiMap<float>(value, in, out, 14);```       |
|    2    |  121.97   |  ```float dist = multiMap<int, float>(value, in, out, 14);```  |

Furthermore it is obvious that there is less need for RAM if the integer type is smaller
in size than the float type.

Be sure to do your own tests to see if MMTT improves your performance.


## Operation

See examples

Please note the fail example as this shows that in the intern math overflow can happen.


## Future

#### Must

- improve documentation

#### Should

- investigate multiMapCache behaviour
  - determine overhead.
- extend unit tests
  - multi type versions

#### Could

- Investigate class implementation
  - basic call ```out = mm.map(value);```
  - runtime adjusting input and output array **begin(in[], out[])**
  - performance / footprint
  - less parameter passing
  - **isInRange(value)**?
  - caching last value / position / index (does that help?)
  - flag if input value was "IN_MIN" <  input < "IN_MAX", 
    now it is constrained without user being informed.
- Investigate a 2D multiMap, 3D multiMap
  - is it possible / feasible?  (YES | ??)
  - float ==> complex  (Y)
  - e.g. time ==> XY position  (Y)
  - complex ==> complex (?)
  - X ==> { Y, Z } in fact 2 output arrays.
  - needs other API call.
  - can be implemented with multiple single MM calls, 
    one per dimension.
- can the single type version be implemented with the two type version?

#### Wont

- should the lookup tables be merged into one array of pairs?
  - you cannot reuse e.g. the input array or the output array then. 
    this would not improve the memory footprint.
