 *  @brief Example how to use buttonRead8()
 *  
 *  buttonRead8() works the same as buttonRead() but works on all 
 *  pins simultaneous. You can give a mask as parameter to decide which 
 *  pins are affected (aka, made high for a short periode) during 
 *  a buttonRead8(). 
 *  
 *  The mask can also be set with setButtonMask(mask). Calling buttonRead8() 
 *  after that will be the same as calling buttonRead8(mask).
 *  
 *  ButtonRead8() can also be used for pins that are input only.
 *  
 *  In this example pin 0 of the PCF8574 (address 0x20) is used to blink a 
 *  LED but at the same time it can be used to toggle the onboard LED of 
 *  the Arduino.
 *  
 *  Pin 1 is also toggle but isn't affected by the buttonRead8();
 *  
 *  NOTE: The button will affect the LED on the same pin. The led will light up 
 *  no matter the set output state when you press the button.
