# PulsePattern

Arduino Library to generate repeating pulse patterns **AVR ONLY**.


## Description

This is an **experimental** library to generate pulse patterns by means of an Arduino UNO.
As the library uses **AVR hardware timers** it is definitely **NOT** working for ESP
or other non-AVR processors.

The library uses timer1 for the timing of the pulses.
Therefore the class is implemented with a static instance called PPO.
Still by calling **init()** one can change all parameters of the process.
One should note that calling **init()** forces the timer to stop.

The timer code is based upon the website of Nick Gammon which
holds quite a lot of good solid material (Thanks Nick!).

Use with care.

Note: there is no active development.


## Interface

```cpp
#include "PulsePattern.h"
```

### Constructor

- **PulsePattern()** constructor
- **void init(uint8_t pin, uint16_t\*ar, uint8_t size, luint8_t evel, uint8_t prescaler)** initializer of the Timer1
   - pin that outputs the pattern
   - array of durations
   - size (or part) of the array to be used
   - starting level HIGH/LOW
   - pre-scaler, one of the 5 defines from .h file (table below)
- **void setFactor(float perc)** percentage = factor to correct timing (relative).
- **float getFactor()** get the internal used factor. Due to rounding it can be slightly different.

### Control

- **void stop()** stop the pattern generator
- **void start(uint32_t times = PP_CONTINUOUS)** start the pattern generator.
Default in the continuous mode to be backwards compatible.
**PP_CONTINUOUS** == 0xFFFFFFFF, so times should be less than 4294967295. 
For convenience there is a **PP_ONCE** == 1 defined.
- **void cont()** continue the pattern generator from the last stopped place (approx).
- **bool isRunning()** status indicator
- **void worker()** must be public otherwise the ISR cannot call it.

There is some bad understood __vector_11() error when worker() is private.


## Pre-scaler constants

|  Value  |  Prescaler       |  Timer1      |  Notes       |
|:-------:|:-----------------|:-------------|:------------:|
|    0    |  NO_CLOCK        |  timer off   |              |
|    1    |  PRESCALE_1      |  clk / 1     |
|    2    |  PRESCALE_8      |  clk / 8     |
|    3    |  PRESCALE_64     |  clk / 64    |
|    4    |  PRESCALE_256    |  clk / 250   |
|    5    |  PRESCALE_1024   |  clk / 1024  |  about 1 ms / pulse
|    6    |  EXT_T1_FALLING  |  T1 = pin 5  |  not tested
|    7    |  EXT_T2_RISING   |              |  not tested


# Operation

See examples.


## Future

#### Must

#### Should

#### Could

- ESP32 variant of this class (base class -> AVR -> ESP class)
- pulse recorder class to record / generate patterns
- add interval between patterns?
  - or is this just LOW/HIGH for a certain time.
if time permits ...

#### Wont
